_Good-Enough Golfers_ is a near-solver for a class of scheduling problems including the
[Social Golfer Problem](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SocialGolferProblem.html) and
[Kirkman's Schoolgirl Problem](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KirkmansSchoolgirlProblem.html).
The goal is to schedule `g x p` players into `g` groups of size `p` for `w` weeks such that no two players meet more
than once.

Real solutions to these problems can be extremely slow, but approximations are fast and often good enough for real-world purposes.
